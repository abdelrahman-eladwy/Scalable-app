## Project Overview

This repository documents a robust, cloud-native web application infrastructure built on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The architecture prioritizes fault tolerance, seamless scalability, and operational excellence through comprehensive monitoring and automated responses.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Deliver high availability with zero single points of failure
- Provide elastic scaling capabilities that respond to demand
- Maintain strong security posture with network isolation
- Enable proactive operational management through automation

**Core Infrastructure Elements:**
- Multi-zone EC2 deployment for application hosting
- Application Load Balancer for intelligent traffic distribution
- Auto Scaling Groups enabling dynamic capacity management
- Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ configuration for database reliability
- CloudWatch-based monitoring ecosystem
- SNS-powered notification framework

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Fault Tolerance**: Architecture survives individual component failures
- **Elastic Scaling**: Resources automatically adjust to workload variations
- **Defense in Depth**: Layered security controls protect infrastructure
- **Automation First**: Self-healing capabilities minimize manual intervention

## System Architecture

The infrastructure follows a multi-tier architecture pattern distributed across two Availability Zones:

## Infrastructure Components

### Application Tier

**Amazon EC2 Instances**
- Virtual compute resources hosting the web application
- Distributed across multiple Availability Zones for redundancy
- Configured through standardized Launch Templates

**Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**
- Maintains desired instance count automatically
- Scales horizontally based on performance metrics
- Ensures minimum capacity during maintenance or failures

**Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- Intelligently routes incoming requests across healthy instances
- Performs continuous health monitoring
- Automatically isolates unhealthy targets from traffic flow

### Data Tier

**Amazon RDS Multi-AZ Configuration**
- **Primary Database Instance**: Handles all read/write operations
- **Standby Replica**: Synchronously replicated in separate AZ for failover
- Deployed in private subnets with restricted access
- Accessible only from application instances within the VPC

### Observability Stack

**Amazon CloudWatch**
- Centralized metrics collection and analysis
- Custom dashboards for operational visibility
- Automated threshold-based alerting

**CloudWatch Alarms**
- Performance threshold monitoring (CPU utilization > 80%)
- Health check failure detection
- Database resource consumption tracking

**Amazon SNS**
- Multi-channel notification delivery (email, SMS)
- Integration capability with automation workflows
- Escalation path configuration for critical alerts

## Network Security Design

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Architecture

The network foundation spans two Availability Zones with carefully segmented access controls.

### Subnet Configuration

**Public Subnets**
- Host internet-facing components (ALB, EC2 instances)
- Connected to Internet Gateway via public route tables
- Enable direct internet connectivity for web traffic

**Private Subnets**
- Contain sensitive database infrastructure
- Isolated from direct internet access
- Accessible only through internal VPC routing

### Traffic Routing

**Public Route Tables**
- Direct external traffic (`0.0.0.0/0`) through Internet Gateway
- Enable bidirectional internet connectivity

**Private Route Tables**
- Restrict routing to internal VPC communication only
- Prevent unauthorized external access to database tier

### Security Group Configuration

**Application Instance Security Groups**
- Accept HTTP/HTTPS traffic exclusively from Load Balancer
- Deny all other inbound connections

**Load Balancer Security Groups**
- Allow internet traffic on standard web ports (80, 443)
- Forward only legitimate requests to application instances

**Database Security Groups**
- Permit connections solely from application security groups
- Restrict access to database port (3306 for MySQL)

### Internet Connectivity

**Internet Gateway**
- Provides managed internet access for public subnet resources
- Eliminates need for NAT Gateway due to public subnet deployment

## Observability and Alerting

### Performance Monitoring

**EC2 Metrics**
- CPU utilization patterns and trends
- Network throughput (ingress/egress)
- Instance health check status

**RDS Metrics**
- Database CPU performance
- Active connection monitoring
- Storage capacity utilization

### Proactive Alerting

**Threshold-Based Alarms**
- CPU utilization exceeding 80% triggers scaling events
- Instance health check failures prompt immediate investigation
- Database storage depletion warnings prevent service disruption

**Notification Workflows**
- Operations team receives instant alerts via multiple channels
- Integration points available for automated remediation workflows

## Resilience and Auto-Scaling

### Geographic Distribution
- Resources deployed across multiple Availability Zones
- Ensures service continuity during zone-level failures

### Dynamic Scaling Capabilities
- Auto Scaling Groups respond to real-time demand metrics
- Horizontal scaling maintains performance during traffic spikes
- Cost optimization through automatic scale-down during low usage

### Database High Availability
- Multi-AZ RDS deployment provides automatic failover
- Standby instance ensures minimal downtime during primary failures

### Health Management
- Application Load Balancer continuously validates instance health
- Unhealthy instances automatically removed from service rotation
- Traffic redistribution maintains user experience during failures
